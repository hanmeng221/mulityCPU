  Number of MUXCYs used:                        32 out of  31,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          187
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            32 out of     187   17%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              10 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
